# ng5flatpickr demo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.
It is used to test implementation of flatpickr library in an Angular 5 project. On the flatpicker repo website you will find excellent documentation and lot of examples. This project is simply used to practice these examples and combine them in the way I need these in mine projects. Using separate project to test ensures that no other 'third party libraries' interferre and influence the outcome of testing. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## [Datepickr](https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/)

flatpickr is a lightweight and powerful datetime picker. Lean, UX-driven, and extensible, yet it doesn’t depend on any libraries. There’s minimal UI but many themes. Rich, exposed APIs and event system make it suitable for any environment. More info is available at [flatpickr repo](https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/).
